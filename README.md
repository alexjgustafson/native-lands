# Native Lands Search

Made with love for the folks at [Pipewrench Magazine](https://pipewrenchmag.com). 

This WordPress plugin creates a block allowing your readers to search for a location and see a list of native territories that historically contained it.

Powered by the [native-land.ca API](https://native-land.ca/resources/api-docs/) and [Google Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview).

## Requirements
* PHP 7.4+
* WordPress 5.7+
* Google Geocoding API Key
